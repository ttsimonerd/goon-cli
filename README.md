> 🗣: Bradar what is this for?
This is a small project developed by me, I did this because I was bored and I like to goon but I couldn't decide what to goon to, so here it is.
### The goon decision maker!

## ✨ Features (AI-redacted bc Im lazy asf)
- Animated ASCII banner
- Random color effects
- Smooth scrolling intro
- Blinking cursor
- Customizable themes
- Installable as a real CLI command

## 🚀 Installation

### Install it from source with this simple command: (I will not publish the project to PyPI, so don't expect a shorter command)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ttsimonerd/goon-cli
```
## 🔃 Updating

### To update the program use this simple built-in command:
```bash
goon update
```
